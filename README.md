# Basic Derivative Calculator (Power Rule)

This is a basic c++ script that can calculate any derivative that requires the power rule (it won't simplify, sorry)

Basic examples:

```sh
$ derive "3x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x + 8"
# (3(3x^2)) + 4(2x) + 2)
```

Currently, this is the most of its power. If you want to add stuff like the chain rule, multiplication or division with the variable (possibly add the ability to change the variable), etc. go ahead and create a pull request.

This project was made as some "challenge" joke with someone I know (as derivatives are computationally expensive and hard to calculate technically without a specific point). In all seriousness, this is a random project and I probably wont continue it unless I have more free time (probably towards the start of June?)
